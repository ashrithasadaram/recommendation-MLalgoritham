# recommendation-MLalgoritham
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences. Built with Python, the system leverages machine learning techniques and natural language processing to analyze movie metadata and generate personalized recommendations.
The project is developed and tested in JupyterLab and PyCharm, with a Streamlit interface for interactive deployment.
